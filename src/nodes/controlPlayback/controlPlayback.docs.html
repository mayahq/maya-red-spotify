<h3>How "toggleRepeat" works</h3>
<p>
    When you set the action to "toggleRepeat", you will also additionally need to specify the repeatMode property. 
    The property can have the following values (you will need to type these out in the field) -
</p>
<dl class="message-properties">
    <dt>
        <span class="property-name">track</span>
        <span class="property-type">string</span>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Set repeatMode to "track" to repeat the currently playing track
    </dd>

    <dt>
        <span class="property-name">context</span>
        <span class="property-type">string</span>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Set repeatMode to "context" to repeat the currently playing context, i.e., repeat currently playing album, 
        playlist, etc.
    </dd>

    <dt>
        <span class="property-name">off</span>
        <span class="property-type">string</span>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Set repeatMode to "off" to turn off repeat.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>How "toggleShuffle" works</h3>
<p>
    When you set the action to "toggleShuffle", you will also additionally need to specify the shuffleMode property. 
    The property can have the following values (you will need to type these out in the field) -
</p>
<dl class="message-properties">
    <dt>
        <span class="property-name">true</span>
        <span class="property-type">string</span>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Set shuffleMode to "true" to turn shuffle on.
    </dd>

    <dt>
        <span class="property-name">false</span>
        <span class="property-type">string</span>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Set shuffleMode to "false" to turn shuffle off.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>How "addToQueue" works</h3>
<p>
    When you set the action to "addToQueue", you will also additionally need to specify the trackUri property. This 
    corresponds to the URI of the track (for example, <i>spotify:track:4iV5W9uYEdYUVa79Axb7Rh</i>) that you want to add to the queue.
